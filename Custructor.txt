----- Constructor -----
Constructor has same name as class.
There is no return type for constructor including void.
if you have not create constructor explicitly then compiler assume that is default constructor.
we can't call constructor inside constructor.

----- Differentiate: Method & Constructor -----
Method: Method name can be decided by user.
Const: Name and class name should be same compulsorily
Method: needs to be explicitly called.
Const: is called implicitly during the object creation.
Method: has return type.
Const: doesn't have return type.
Method: we can call a method in the constructor. 
Const: we can't call constructor in constructor.
Method: when method are same name that is method overloading we need to change return type/parameters.
Const: in overloading we can create multiple constructor with only different parameters.
