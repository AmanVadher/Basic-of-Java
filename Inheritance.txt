----- Inheritance in Java [29/04] -----

-Inheritance in java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a
parent object. It is an important part of OOPs.
-When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and felids of the parent class. Moreover,
you can add new methods and felids in your current class also.
-Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent child relationship.
