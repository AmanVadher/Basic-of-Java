----- Immutable Class [ 27/03 ] -----
Immutable Class' value can not be changed.
Declare the class as final so it cannot be extended.
all class member should be private so they cannot be accessed outside of class.
class member are only initialized in class.

--- This Keyword ---
Reference variable that refers to the current object.

Example:
ArrayObj(double rate, String name, int id){
    this.rate = rate;
    this.name = name;
    this.id = id;
}

-- Usage:
1. this can be used to refer current class interface variable.
2. this can be used to invoke current class method(implicitly).
3. invoke current class constructor.
4. passed as an argument in the method call.
5. passed as argument in the constructor call.
6. return the current class instance from the method.

--- Accessing private members in class ---
When ever variable of class is declared private that is (private datatype variableName;) then you can not
access that variable directly in the main function even with the help of object.

-- Solution to this is as follows:
1. Usage of parameterized constructor just to initialize the values.
2. Assign the private variable to a public variable of the same class.
    Ex: private int a;
        int b = a;
        // use variable b everywhere
        // this hold true when a is in class
3. compulsorily follow for dynamic usage.
    -declare a public method in which you can directly use variable a for initializing for performing
    operation on it.
    -public method can void or any return type parameterized or non-parameterized.
    -call this method in main function thought object a to access variable name.
    -Note:Static private variable can be access thought static methods only.
    -Similarly when a class method is declared private you need to create a public method, call the
    private method call private method a inside b and then call public method b in the main function.
